# chca
CHCA simple cellular automaton program

I made this years ago as a simple experiment on 1-D cellular automata,

then I got ambitious and wanted to add more dimensions, but somehow

forgot about the project for years.

I would still like to do more with it at some point.

Right now this is very simple -- it makes a simple "Wolfram style" 1D CA
with Wolfram's numbering system.

Usage example:

chca 110
